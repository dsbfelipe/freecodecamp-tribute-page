**Certification Project**

Project for _freeCodeCamp_ **Responsive Web Design** course

A tribute page for the kpop group NewJeans using HTML and CSS.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to make an app similar to "https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks" for a subject of my choosing and passing the test's requirements, practicing what was learned on the second module of the course, like the **CSS Box Model**, **Flexbox** and **Typography**.

### **Acknowledgments**

I've got the stickers images from the https://girlsprintinghouse.com/ website and just removed the background on GIMP.
