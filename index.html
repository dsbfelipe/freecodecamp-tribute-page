                    <p class="fifty"><span class="pink bold">NewJeans</span> (Korean: <span class="pink bold">Îâ¥ÏßÑÏä§</span>; RR: Nyujinseu) is a South Korean girl group formed by ADOR. The group is composed of five members: <span class="pink bold">Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin and Hyein</span>. NewJeans rose to prominence upon their debut in 2022 with their girl next door image and "easy listening" pop and R&B songs inspired by the music of the 1990s.</p>
                    <p class="fifty">They debuted in July 2022 with the single <span class="pink bold">"Attention"</span>, their first number-one song on South Korea's Circle Digital Chart. It was followed shortly afterwards by two other singles, <span class="pink bold">"Hype Boy"</span> and <span class="pink bold">"Cookie"</span>. The singles were all featured on their eponymous debut extended play, released in August 2022. In January 2023, they released their first single album, <span class="pink bold">OMG</span>, to commercial success. It was accompanied by two singles, <span class="pink bold">"Ditto"</span> and <span class="pink bold">"OMG"</span>. <span class="pink bold">"Ditto"</span> gained widespread popularity, becoming the longest-running number-one song on the Circle Digital Chart and the group's first entry on both the Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart.</p> 
                    <p class="fifty">After their successful debut, <span class="pink bold">NewJeans</span> received several rookie awards and were featured in listicles such as Time's Next Generation Leaders and Forbes's Korea Power Celebrity 40. Aside from music, NewJeans has sponsored and collaborated with several brands, including <span class="pink bold">Musinsa [ko], Levi's, Coca-Cola, LG Electronics, and McDonald's Korea</span>.</p>
                    <p class="fifty">The group's name, <span class="pink bold">NewJeans</span>, is a double entendre. It alludes to the idea that jeans are a timeless fashion item and the group's intention to carve a timeless image for themselves. The name is also a word play on the phrase "new genes", referring to the group ushering a new generation of pop music.</p>
